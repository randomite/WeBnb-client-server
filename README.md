## Guidelines

### General
  Every sprint will have a `develop` branch. Branch from the `develop` branch for each task that is assigned to you. At the end of the sprint we will merge all those branches into the current `develop` branch. The `develop` branch will then be merged into the `master` branch at the end of every sprint.
  
### Pull Request
  The following procedure should be followed when creating a pull requrest. The repository requires 2 approvals on a pull request (PR) to merge branches. 
  1. Create a pull request with the title being the task name.
  2. Assign yourself as the owner of the PR.
  3. Assign a minimum of 2 other, preferably front-end,  developers to review your code.
  4. Add the labels that are appropriate for your PR.
  5. Add screenshots at browser (1280x720) size and iPhone 6 size
  6. Include a link to the Trello card, so that we know what issue you are working on in the sprint.
